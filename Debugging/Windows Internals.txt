Starting with Windows 8, a sandbox called an AppContainer is used to host Windows Apps, which
provides isolation with relation to other AppContainers and non–Windows Apps processes. Code in
AppContainers can communicate with brokers (non-isolated processes running with the user’s credentials)
and sometimes other AppContainers or processes through well-defined contracts provided by the
Windows Runtime. A canonical example is the Microsoft Edge browser that runs inside an AppContainer
and thus provides better protection against malicious code running within its boundaries. Additionally,
third-party developers can leverage AppContainers to isolate their own non–Windows Apps applications
in similar ways. The AppContainer model forces a significant shift in traditional programming
paradigms, moving from the traditional multithreaded single-process application implementation to
a multi-process one.
