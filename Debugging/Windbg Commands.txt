	bp vs bu
Breakpoints that you set with bp are not saved in WinDbg workspaces.
Breakpoints that are set with bu are saved in workspaces.
---------------------------------
			bm usage

example.
	0:000> bm myprogram!mem* 
	4: 0040d070 MyProgram!memcpy
	5: 0040c560 MyProgram!memmove
	6: 00408960 MyProgram!memset

----------------------------------------------
If you specify Thread, breakpoints are set on the specified threads.
For example, the ~*bp command sets breakpoints on all threads,
~#bp sets a breakpoint on the thread that causes the current exception,
and ~123bp sets a breakpoint on thread 123.
The ~bp and ~.bp commands both set a breakpoint on the current thread.
